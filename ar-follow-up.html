            <ul class="service-list">
                <li>Work closely with each practice to have superior front desk processes to maximize the number of clean claims filed.</li>
                <li>Monitor and provide monthly reports on the number of claims filed and the number of claims submitted that weren’t clean.</li>
                <li>Work denied claims within 48 hours of being notified they have been denied.</li>
                <li>Follow up on self-pay accounts with no response from the patient at 60 days.</li>
                <li>Double check all accounts with balances over 60 days past due to be sure action is being taken to resolve issues.</li>
                <li>Document all actions the system allows so clients have access to whatever action MPMS has taken.</li>
                <li>Review returned mail for action within 48 hours of receipt.</li>
                <li>Review credit balances each month and collaborate with the client for their resolution.</li>
                <li>Strive for less than 10% of accounts receivable being over 120 days old.</li>
