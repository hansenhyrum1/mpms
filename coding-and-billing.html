            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>Your practice retains primary coding responsibility, but MPMS reviews complex cases within the standard billing fee and asks for documentation when needed to ensure the appropriate code is used. We keep a curated library of coding resources, including reference materials, association guidance, and government tools.</p>
